ðŸš€ SpaceX Falcon 9 Rocket Landing Prediction â€“ Data Science Capstone
A machine learning pipeline built to predict the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landings using publicly available data from the SpaceX API and Wikipedia. This capstone project was developed as part of the IBM Data Science Specialization.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objective
SpaceX significantly reduces launch costs by reusing the Falcon 9's first stage. Predicting the likelihood of a successful landing can offer critical insights for stakeholders and competitors.
This project answers:

What factors determine a successful rocket landing?

How do different features interact to impact landing success?

What are the best operating conditions for a successful launch?

ðŸ§  Methodology
Data Collection:

Used SpaceX REST API

Web scraped Falcon 9 launch records from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup

Data Wrangling:

Cleaned and merged data, handled missing values

Performed one-hot encoding for categorical features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized relationships between payload, orbit type, launch sites, and outcomes

Used SQL and PostgreSQL for deeper data insights

Interactive Visualizations:

Built a map using Folium to analyze launch site proximity

Created an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash for user-driven exploration

Machine Learning Pipeline:

Applied Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and KNN classifiers

Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

Achieved best accuracy with the Decision Tree Classifier

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
Higher flight numbers generally correlate with greater landing success

Specific orbits (e.g., ES-L1, GEO, SSO) have higher success rates

Payload and launch site combinations strongly affect landing outcome

Launch site KSC LC-39A has the highest success rate at 76.9%
